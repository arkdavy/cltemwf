# cltemwf

A wrapper for creating templated workflows for [clTEM](https://jjppeters.github.io/clTEM) code.
One can run the workflow from within a bash script and a python script as well. 
Follow the example file `examples/run_batch.sh` with a description of these two cases.

Run `pip install .` to install the package (or `pip install . --user` for the `home/` installation)
